    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>As a lover of bands like Kerbera, Modern day escape, Jigsaw, Your Band, Beyond Unbroken, and The Sway, I got my beginnings in the music industry by interviewing bands.
      As time went on, I felt the need to pivot into becoming a booking agent which has been far more successful and rewarding for me. I am looking forward to working with newer and upcoming acts in the future.
